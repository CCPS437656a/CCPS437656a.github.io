    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>1. What I am trying to work on my personal life is to get good grades and a high GPA so I can get my diploma. Use that diploma so can get a job that I will enjoy and pay. The experience that could lead me there are doing well in school being a good person out school like not making dumb decisions.

2. I am trying to get good grades by turning my assignments in on time and try to get the answers right. To get a 3 or more on the FSA so I can get out of intensive. I need to focus more on school then on other enjoyments like TV or video games I will enjoy these but school is first. 

3.Hard working, organized, and putting school first. Having your things ready so your teacher can teach. Focusing on what the teacher is teaching so you know what to do or see if you have any questions. 

4. One goal is to get good grades so I can finish the year strong. Second goal is to get a high GPA. To be me more social with people and not stress over anything to little. 

5. I would like to be known for my intelligence. I want to be known for my kindness to other people. To be known for my endurance and determination.</p></body>
